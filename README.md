Cyber Operations student building hands-on experience in cybersecurity, digital forensics, cloud, and defensive tooling. I enjoy learning by doing—whether that’s running investigations in my home lab, experimenting with virtualization, or developing small open-source tools to support layered defense.

This GitHub hosts my projects, scripts, labs, and ongoing research as I continue growing into a cybersecurity professional.
